## face_similarity.py
This script compares a given image with a set of images in a directory to find the most similar face. It uses the face_recognition library to encode and compare faces. If a face in the directory is similar enough to the given image, the script outputs the percentage of similarity and displays the face image. If there is no similar face, the script outputs a message.

## face_recognition.py
This code is a Python module for face detection and recognition using the dlib library. It defines several functions for face detection, landmark detection, and face recognition, along with some utility functions.

## face_comp.py
This Python script uses the face_recognition library to compare a target image with a set of known images in a given directory. For each known image, it computes the similarity between the target image and the known image based on facial features. It then prints the similarity score for each known image and identifies the known image with the highest similarity score as the best match. Finally, it displays the best match image using the PIL library.

## accuracy.py
This Python script uses the face_recognition library to compare a set of known images (in a given directory) with a set of target images (in another directory). For each known image, it computes the similarity between the known image and all the target images and identifies the target image with the highest similarity score as the best match. If the similarity score is above a given threshold, it prints the match and the corresponding similarity score. Otherwise, it prints "No match". At the end, it computes the accuracy by dividing the number of matches by the total number of known images and prints the accuracy score.
